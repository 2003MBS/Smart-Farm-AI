# 🌾 Smart Farm AI – Modern Farming, Smarter Decisions

**Smart Farm AI** is an intelligent farm management system that leverages modern technologies like Artificial Intelligence, IoT, and real-time data processing to optimize farming operations. It empowers farmers to monitor, analyze, and manage agricultural activities efficiently, helping increase productivity, reduce waste, and make informed decisions.

## 🚜 Overview

Smart Farm AI provides a centralized platform to:

- Monitor environmental and soil conditions  
- Automate irrigation and crop scheduling  
- Predict crop yields and detect plant diseases  
- Manage resources like water, fertilizer, and manpower  
- Provide real-time analytics and alerts for better decision-making  

## 🌟 Key Features

- 📡 IoT Sensor Integration for real-time monitoring (temperature, humidity, soil moisture)  
- 🤖 AI-based prediction models for crop yield and disease detection  
- 💧 Smart irrigation management system  
- 🗂️ Dashboard for farm data visualization and insights  
- 📱 Responsive interface accessible on desktop and mobile  
- 🧑‍🌾 User-friendly system for farmers and agri-businesses  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python Flask  
- **Database:** NoSQL (JSON-based data storage)  
- **AI Models:** TensorFlow / Scikit-learn (for prediction & detection)  
- **Optional Integrations:** MQTT for sensor communication, Google Maps API for field mapping
